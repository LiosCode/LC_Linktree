This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Important!

To personalize your Linktree, please change the images in the public directory to your own images and also change the image names in the source code of the page. Alternatively, you can just add your profile pictures/company favicon using the already used name 'dein-foto.jpg'. For a Linktree that serves your interests, do not forget to change the links as well to your own web links/social media links. If you need other favicons for Facebook, X, or LinkedIn, for example, you can use the following website:
https://uxwing.com







Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
